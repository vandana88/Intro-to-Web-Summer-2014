1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,800
We've learned the basic syntax of CSS.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,610
Now, let's build on that knowledge and
style our project.

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:13,490
As we move forward, we'll learn about lots
of selectors, properties, and values.

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,870
To start out, we'll style the basic
elements of our site.

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,970
If you were following along with our
previous

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,880
example, let's delete the style element
that we created,

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,620
because it was only for the purposes of
the example.

8
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,990
We won't need that code in our actual
project.

9
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,595
Next let's create a stylesheet.

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,540
So we'll create a new file by right
clicking on the file tree.

11
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,030
And we'll call it main.css.

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,950
But you can call yours whatever you'd
like.

13
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,060
As long as it has the .css file

14
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,750
extension and you remember what you called
it.

15
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,850
Now, once I create the file, you'll notice
that it automatically opens it up for me.

16
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,650
But first, we need to move this into our
CSS

17
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:07,660
directory, so I'm going to click and drag
it into CSS.

18
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,130
There we go.

19
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,510
And before we get started coding over here
in main.css,

20
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,730
we want to make sure that we add this to

21
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:21,488
our HTML file.
So, this is going to be very similar to

22
00:01:21,488 --> 00:01:27,150
our previous line of CSS.
I'm going to copy that and paste it below,

23
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:33,643
so I've copied the normalize.css line
here, and I've pasted it below.

24
00:01:33,643 --> 00:01:40,449
And I need to change the filename here to
main.css.

25
00:01:40,449 --> 00:01:42,273
And I'm going to go ahead and

26
00:01:42,273 --> 00:01:47,112
save that.
Because of the cascading nature of CSS,

27
00:01:47,112 --> 00:01:52,348
it's important that our CSS, or main.css,
comes

28
00:01:52,348 --> 00:01:57,353
after normalize.css.
We don't want normalize

29
00:01:57,353 --> 00:02:02,408
to overwrite any of our CSS.
And conversely, we want

30
00:02:02,408 --> 00:02:07,400
to make sure that normalize comes first
and sets up a solid

31
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,987
foundation for our custom CSS.
In fact, we might be overriding

32
00:02:12,987 --> 00:02:18,920
some rules in normalize.css.
So we want main to come after normalize.

33
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,510
That's very important.

34
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:27,040
Now let's jump into our CSS document,
which I've called main.css.

35
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,470
And let's try a really dramatic and
obvious change, just to make sure

36
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,810
that our CSS is included properly.

37
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:41,730
I'm going to select the body element,
which is basically the entire page,

38
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:47,870
and I'm going to change the background
color to orange.

39
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:53,030
So, I'll type background-color and change
it to orange.

40
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,502
If we save the file and refresh our
preview, you can

41
00:02:57,502 --> 00:03:03,821
see that the background for the entire
page has been changed to orange.

42
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:12,190
So we know that main.css has indeed been
included properly into our HTML file.

43
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,150
If, for some reason, your background color
doesn't change

44
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:21,380
to orange, make sure to first check the
syntax here.

45
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,730
And then also check

46
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:27,990
to make sure that main.css comes after
normalize, and

47
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:33,263
that the path is correct.
It needs to be the CSS folder

48
00:03:33,263 --> 00:03:37,861
and then main.css, and your main.css file

49
00:03:37,861 --> 00:03:43,030
needs to be inside the CSS folder.
It's very important

50
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,830
as well.
Now, I don't want my body background color

51
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:53,090
to be orange, so I've highlighted
everything by hitting Cmd+A on a Mac,

52
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:58,500
or Ctrl+A if you're on Windows, and I'll
delete everything in the file.

53
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,110
Now, I want to remove the underline that's
on our

54
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:06,300
links, I want to have links that don't
have an underline.

55
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:13,212
So I'm going to select all of the anchor
elements on our page, and I'm going

56
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:18,533
to type the property text-decoration and
set it to none.

57
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:22,970
And if I save that, go back to the
browser, and refresh.

58
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:26,270
You'll see that first, our background
color has, once again, defaulted

59
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:31,640
to white, and there are no longer any
underlines on our links.

60
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,980
Great, now let's start organizing our
layout a little bit.

61
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,630
We need to add some markup in order

62
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:43,880
to wrap the main part of our content and
select it appropriately.

63
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:49,200
To do that, we're first going to switch
back over to our HTML and create an

64
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:55,300
element called a div, which doesn't have
any semantic meaning at all.

65
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:01,380
Rather it's a way for us to encapsulate or
divide a group of elements.

66
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,760
Let's open our div right

67
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:09,980
after our header element.
So we'll go here, in between

68
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:16,100
our header and section, we'll type div,
and then we're going to close this

69
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:23,340
just between our footer and body here.
And you'll notice that work spaces has

70
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:28,070
actually highlighted body and html in red.
That's because it's

71
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:33,800
saying, somewhere in here, there's a tag
that is not closed.

72
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,809
And in our case, that's the div.

73
00:05:36,809 --> 00:05:41,950
And if we type that in, you'll see that it
automatically closes for us.

74
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,300
Now we have a lot

75
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,730
of code that needs to be indented by one
tab.

76
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:54,440
So, starting at the footer down here at
the bottom, going all the way up

77
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:01,630
to my section here, just before this dig.
I'm going to select everything.

78
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:06,010
And to do that, I just hold down Shift and
click right here.

79
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:09,017
Then again, to indent on a Mac, I'm

80
00:06:09,017 --> 00:06:13,910
going to hit Cmd and then closing square
bracket.

81
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,780
And on Windows, you hit Ctrl and square

82
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:21,460
bracket, and that will indent everything
by one.

83
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,440
So now it's indented by one tab over from
our

84
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,670
div, and that will help to keep our code
organized.

85
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,650
You'll notice that we also have some more

86
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:34,020
line wrapping going on here, but that's
perfectly fine,

87
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,030
that doesn't effect the functionality of
the code.

88
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,490
Now, we will probably have many divs on
the page, so

89
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:46,450
we need to identify this div more
specifically according to its function.

90
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:53,170
So inside of our opening div tag right
here, I'm going to type a space,

91
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:59,450
and then I'm gonna add an attribute called
id to identify it.

92
00:06:59,450 --> 00:06:59,820
And

93
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,650
I'm going to name this id wrapper.

94
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,120
And I can go ahead and name this whatever
I want, just like I

95
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,600
can type anything into an alt attribute,

96
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,620
or anything into a source or href
attribute.

97
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:19,570
So I've called this div wrapper, and an id
attribute will

98
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:25,190
uniquely identify elements on the page.
So now if we save this and

99
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:29,970
switch over to our CSS, we can go ahead
and type a

100
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:34,940
hash or a pound symbol, followed by the
name of the id.

101
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,860
So we've called it wrapper, and then we
can go ahead and open up

102
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:43,370
our curly braces, and that's going to
select that div that we just created.
